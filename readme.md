# LibAcademy: Revolutionizing Education

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to LibAcademy, an education platform revolutionizing the way tutors create and deliver courses, and learners access personalized learning experiences.

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional education platforms often lack flexibility, forcing tutors to conform to a standardized format and limiting learners' choices. This centralized approach restricts innovation in teaching methods and fails to cater to diverse learning preferences.

## 3. Solution Overview

LibAcademy offers a decentralized education platform where tutors have the freedom to design their own courses and customize their user interface (UI) to suit their teaching style. We provide a pool of developers who assist tutors in creating their desired UI and implementing functionalities tailored to their courses.

## 4. Key Features

- **Freedom for Tutors**: Tutors can create courses without constraints, designing their own curriculum and UI.
  - There will be a button to create a course. Upon clicking, the tutor will be asked to set parameters which will be the structure of the course to be created.
  - There will be fields for texts, images, videos, and other files that the tutor wants to upload alongside their course.
  - There will be options to define chapters, topics, subtopics, and other elements to set the proper structure for the course.

- **Customizable UI**: Our platform enables tutors to personalize the learning experience for their students by designing unique interfaces.

- **Developer Support**: A dedicated team of developers is available to assist tutors in implementing desired functionalities.

- **Individualized Learning**: Learners have the freedom to choose tutors based on their teaching style and course offerings, fostering personalized education.
  - Learners can find tutors by searching for the tutorâ€™s name directly or by typing the unique username of a specific tutor.
  - After clicking on the tutor card, they will be shown a list of courses uploaded by the tutor. Upon clicking on a particular course, learners will be able to access the course if it is open to everyone; otherwise, they will have to go through an authorization process to check if they can access the restricted or paid course.

- **Incentivized Development**: Developers are incentivized to contribute to projects and receive certificates for their work, enhancing their skills and resumes.

## 5. Benefits

- **For Tutors**: Empowerment to innovate in teaching methods, access to developer support, and the ability to showcase their unique teaching style.
- **For Learners**: Personalized learning experiences, choice in tutors and courses, and access to diverse educational content.
- **For Developers**: Opportunities for skill development, incentives for project contributions, and valuable experience for future career prospects.

## 6. Development Process

Our platform follows an iterative development process, collaborating closely with tutors to understand their requirements and preferences. Developers work alongside tutors to create customized UI designs and implement desired functionalities. Regular feedback loops ensure continuous improvement and alignment with tutors' goals.
